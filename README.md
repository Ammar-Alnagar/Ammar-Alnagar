🚀 Hey, I’m Ammar!

I’m an AI Software Engineer who loves making large language models smarter, faster, and ready for the wild.
I specialize in LLM optimization, reasoning systems, and building AI that actually works in production.

🧠 Big fan of reasoning-first models and cognitive agents

🛠️ I build AI systems that feel like magic but run on code

⚡ Obsessed with making inference blazingly fast using Rust, Triton, and PyTorch



---

🛠️ What I’m Good At

LLM tuning & deployment – from fine-tuning to RAG, with a side of RLHF

Multimodal AI – mixing vision, language, and interactivity like a mad scientist

System-level speed hacks – squeezing out milliseconds with low-level tricks

EdTech AI – building agents that help people learn (and teach themselves too)



---

🧪 Cool Stuff I’ve Built

🧩 QwQ_Zero1 – My custom-finetuned LLM that actually thinks

🌈 VisoLearn – A VLM for kids with ASD that makes learning fun

🔬 Inference Boosts – Speed-ups with Rust, Triton, and dark GPU magic

🧠 Self-Learning RAG – An evolving retrieval system that gets smarter over time

🎓 Enlightener – AI tutor that gives personalized, deep reasoning feedback



---

⚙️ Currently Powering Up

Kernel wizardry – Custom CUDA kernels, Triton fusion, pushing PyTorch to the limit

Systems deep dive – More Rust, modern C++, and exploring Zig

Tiny models, big impact – Embedding lightweight models into everyday apps

What I optimize and experiment with:

LLM fine-tuning (QwQ_Zero1)
Reinforcement learning (TRL, Unsloth)
RAG systems (Self-Learning RAG)
Vision-Language agents (VisoLearn, Sphinx)
Voice-AI & real-time TTS (Immy)

Systems brain stuff:

Distributed computing, low-level optimization, advanced C++

Cloud & Infra:

AWS (EC2, SageMaker, Lambda), Git, MongoDB, moving into GCP

CLI & Dev joy:

fzf, bat, exa, and other tools that make life better
