# Hey, I'm Ammar Alnagar

### **Lead AI Systems Engineer | M.Sc., Artificial Intelligence**

*I translate cutting-edge research into production-grade AI infrastructure, specializing in ultra-low latency and high-throughput LLM deployment.*

---

## Core Focus

My work targets the bottleneck of generative AI: **speed and stability at scale.**

* **Accelerated Inference:** Pushing model limits using low-level optimization (CUDA, Triton, Mojo).
* **System Engineering:** Building robust systems for model serving, monitoring, and fault-tolerance.
* **Agent Orchestration:** Designing fast, reliable multi-agent control flows.

## Currently Working On

I am actively focused on performance optimization and serving frameworks:

* **vLLM:** Maximizing GPU utilization via continuous batching and custom scheduling.
* **sglang:** Building fast, reliable agents with structural generation and complex control flow.
