# hey, i'm Ammar ðŸ‘‹

Staff GenAI Systems Engineer by day, M.Sc. AI student by night. 
I build production AI systems that scale and research the stuff that'll matter in two years.

## what i do

I work at the intersection of AI research and real-world systems engineering. That means taking bleeding-edge models and making them actually work in productionâ€”fast, reliable, and without burning through compute budgets.

**Day job:** Architecting GenAI systems that handle real user traffic. Multi-agent orchestration, RAG pipelines that don't hallucinate, and LLM inference that doesn't cost a fortune.

**Research:** Currently obsessed with making LLMs smarter through better architectures. 
Created and Working on [Helios Engine](https://github.com/Ammar-Alnagar/Helios-Engine)â€”a Rust framework for LLM agents that prioritizes speed and reliability.
Also exploring graph-based RAG, advanced reranking, and RL for domain-specific models.

## my stack

**Languages:** Rust (when performance matters), Python (for everything else)

**AI/ML:** Advanced RAG systems, multi-agent orchestration, model optimization, distributed training, RLHF pipelines

**Production:** End-to-end system design, efficient inference, model serving at scale

## current experiments

- Graph-based retrieval systems with dynamic reranking
- Chain-of-thought reasoning architectures
- Ultra-low-latency inference in Rust
- Model distillation for specialized domains

## philosophy

Good AI systems should be:
- **Fast** â€” nobody wants to wait 30 seconds for a response
- **Accessible** â€” open source beats paywalls
- **Practical** â€” research is cool, but only if it ships

Everything I build is open source. Knowledge hoarding is how we end up with mediocre AI.
