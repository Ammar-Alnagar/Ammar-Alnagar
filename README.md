# Hey, i'm Ammar 

**Senior GenAI Systems Engineer** | **Open Source Wizard** | **Electric Stone Alchemist**

Been summoning LLMs into production long enough to know which incantations actually work and which ones just set your GPU on fire.

## what i conjure

I'm an **open source wizard** crafting AI systems that survive contact with reality. My spellbook includes:
- RAG pipelines that actually retrieve the right scrolls (not just vibes)
- Multi-agent orchestration that doesn't devolve into digital anarchy
- Inference spells optimized for speed (because nobody wants to wait 30 seconds for enlightenment)
- Cost optimization rituals that keep the bean counters happy

By day: architecting GenAI systems at scale  
By night: M.Sc. AI student (because sleep is overrated)

## current magical artifacts

**[Helios Engine](https://github.com/Ammar-Alnagar/Helios-Engine)** — My magnum opus. LLM agent framework forged in Rust because Python was too slow for my grand designs. As an **electric stone alchemist**, I transmute compiler optimizations into blazing-fast inference. Turns out other wizards find it useful too.

**Research experiments:**
- Graph-based RAG (because flat retrieval is so 2023)
- Reranking alchemy that actually works
- Chain-of-thought architectures without the hallucination tax
- Model distillation (making big brains fit into small skulls)

## my arcane toolkit

**Rust** — when I need the compiler to be my co-pilot (electric stone alchemy at its finest)  
**C/C++** — for when I need to go even closer to the metal  
**Python** — for when I need results before the heat death of the universe

**Specializations:** Advanced RAG incantations • Multi-agent summoning circles • Model optimization rituals • Distributed training ceremonies • RLHF transmutation • Whatever dark arts make the system work
