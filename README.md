🚀 Hey, I’m Ammar!

I’m an AI Infrastructure  Engineer who loves making large language models smarter, faster, and ready for the wild.
I specialize in LLM optimization, reasoning systems, and building AI that actually works in production.

🧠 Big fan of reasoning-first models and cognitive agents

🛠️ I build AI systems that feel like magic but run on code

⚡ Obsessed with making inference blazingly fast using Rust, Triton, and PyTorch



---

🛠️ What I’m Good At

LLM tuning & deployment – from fine-tuning to RAG, with a side of RLHF

Multimodal AI – mixing vision, language, and interactivity like a mad scientist

System-level speed hacks – squeezing out milliseconds with low-level tricks

EdTech AI – building agents that help people learn (and teach themselves too)



---

🧪 Cool Stuff I’ve Built

🧩 Manticore 32B – My custom-finetuned LLM that uses less reasoning and thinking tokens to get the same results 

🌈 VisoLearn – A VLLM Framework for kids with ASD that makes learning fun using GenAI (Text + Image)

🔬 Qwen Griffon  – SLM Finetuned for fast and enhanced reasoning to match SOTA models.

🧠 Self-Learning RAG – An evolving retrieval system that gets smarter over time from user's Chatting

🎓 Enlightener – AI tutor that gives personalized, deep reasoning feedback

🧸 Immy - First AI powered Teddy bear that speaks to the child in real time and learns to match the child behaviour and patterns.
