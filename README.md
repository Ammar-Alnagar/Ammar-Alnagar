### About Me

Hello! I'm Ammar Alnagar, a Cognitive AI Engineer with a passion for machine learning and natural language processing. I've always been fascinated by the potential of large language models (LLMs) and enjoy exploring their capabilities and improving their performance.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing LLMs from scratch and implementing them in language-related projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning reinforcement learning and Rust to optimize my workflows.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about machine learning, deep learning, or natural language processing.
- âš¡ Fun fact: There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.

### Featured Projects

Here are some of my best projects:

#### [Self_learning_RAG_With_COT](https://github.com/Ammar-Alnagar/Self_learning_RAG_With_COT)

[![RAG](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Ammar-Alnagar&repo=Self_learning_RAG_With_COT)](https://github.com/Ammar-Alnagar/Self_learning_RAG_With_COT)

This project focuses on self-learning of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with a complementary answer to teaching (COT) for improving large language models' response generation capabilities.

#### [customer_churn](https://github.com/Ammar-Alnagar/customer_churn)

[![Customer Churn](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Ammar-Alnagar&repo=customer_churn)](https://github.com/Ammar-Alnagar/customer_churn)

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn. It analyzes customer data and provides insights to help companies retain their customers.
