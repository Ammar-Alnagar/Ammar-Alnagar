🚀 **Hey, I'm Ammar**

I work at the intersection of large language models, cognitive science, and systems engineering. My focus is on building **reasoning-first agents** and **modular multi-agent frameworks** that go beyond prompt-response.

- 🧠 Core interest: agents with belief modeling, memory, and long-term goals
- 🔍 I care about making AI useful, interpretable, and actually smart — not just "chatty"

---

🧠 **What I Work On**

- **Cognitive agents** — agents that track goals, beliefs, and mental states  
- **Reasoning pipelines** — LLM stacks designed for logic, not just fluency  
- **Memory systems** — long-term memory, self-reflection, and behavior updates  
- **Tool-using agents** — LangGraph, OpenAI Assistants, Google AI SDK, LangChain  
- **Multi-agent systems** — coordination, planning, modular workflows

🛠️ **Projects**

- **Zirel-0** – DeepSeek-R1-Zero finetuned for better reasoning and minimal hallucination  
- **OR1 Behemoth** – Qwen 3 72B trained for Rust — strongest Rust completion & Generation model available  
- **CogniLink** – LLaMA 3.3 70B with added reasoning + reflection, without losing creative edge  
- **Manticore 32B** – Reasoning-tuned Qwen3-32B with low-latency high-accuracy outputs  
- **VisoLearn** – Multimodal VLLM tutor for neurodivergent learners (ASD)  
- **Qwen Griffon** – Lightweight SLM with enhanced reasoning at low cost  
- **Self-Learning RAG** – Retrieval system that adapts to user context and evolves  
- **Enlightener** – RLHF-trained tutor agent with long-memory and personalized feedback  
- **Immy** – Emotion-aware real-time AI bear with adaptive state modeling
- **Wisal** - a revolutionary, AI-powered educational platform designed specifically for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in real time.
