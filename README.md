# Hey, I’m Ammar  
### GenAI Systems Engineer 
I build **production Systems** that scale:  
- **Fast LLM serving** with vLLM, quantization (AWQ/GPTQ/FP8/ISQ), and distillation  
- **Graph-based RAG** pipelines with dense retrieval + cross-encoder reranking  
- **Multi-agent workflows** using Pydantic and Rig.rs 
- **Lean infrastructure** in Rust and Python—no bloat, just throughput and Compilers error messages. 

Fine-tuned models on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Daemontatox).
