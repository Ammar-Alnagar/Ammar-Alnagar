## 🚀 What I’m Working On  


**🔱 CogniLink 70B - Decoding complexity **
A SOTA model finetuned for reasoning and Chain-of-thought 
design to handle complex problems and reasoning tasks.

**🧠 PathfinderAI 32B – Smarter Thinking**  
A model fine-tuned for **reasoning and problem-solving**, designed to handle complex challenges in real-time.  

**📜 Document Sage – Smarter Data Extraction**  
Developing an AI-powered system for **semantic search** and **contextual understanding**, making document processing faster and smarter.  

**🔗 RAG Architect**  
Experimenting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation to build **context-aware agents** that are efficient and reliable.
